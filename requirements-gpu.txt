# Optional GPU acceleration dependencies
# Install these for NVIDIA GPU support (10-100x speedup on large datasets)

# Choose ONE based on your CUDA version:

# For CUDA 11.x (check with: nvidia-smi)
cupy-cuda11x>=11.0.0

# OR for CUDA 12.x
# cupy-cuda12x>=12.0.0

# Installation instructions:
# 1. Check CUDA version: nvidia-smi
# 2. Install matching CuPy:
#    pip install cupy-cuda11x  # for CUDA 11
#    pip install cupy-cuda12x  # for CUDA 12
#
# 3. Verify GPU works:
#    python -c "import cupy; print(cupy.cuda.Device().name)"
#
# If GPU is not available, the software will automatically fall back to CPU.
